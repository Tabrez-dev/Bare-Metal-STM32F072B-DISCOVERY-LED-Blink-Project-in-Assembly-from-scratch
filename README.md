# STM32F072B-DISCOVERY LED Blink Project

This is a simple embedded project to blink **LED3** (PC6) on the **STM32F072B-DISCOVERY** board. The code initializes GPIO port C, configures pin PC6 as an output, and toggles the LED with a delay to make it blink.

## Project Overview

- The project demonstrates how to configure GPIO ports for output.
- The LED (PC6) is toggled using the STM32F072B-DISCOVERY development board.
- The project is written in assembly and focuses on low-level hardware initialization.

## Hardware Used

- **STM32F072B-DISCOVERY** board
- **LED3** connected to **PC6**

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/STM32F072B_LED_Blink.git
   cd STM32F072B_LED_Blink
